## üîß Technical Implementation

### Data Models

#### Part Interface
```typescript
interface Part {
  id: string;
  partNumber: string;
  name: string;
  stockQuantity: number;
  minStockLevel: number;
  maxStockLevel: number;
  reorderPoint: number;
  safetyStock: number;
  economicOrderQuantity: number;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

#### Stock Alert Interface
```typescript
interface StockAlert {
  id: string;
  partId: string;
  alertType: AlertType;
  severity: AlertSeverity;
  message: string;
  currentStock: number;
  threshold: number;
  recommendedAction: string;
  // ... additional fields
}
```

### Core Services

#### InventoryService
The main service class that handles:
- Stock status calculations
- Alert generation
- Reorder recommendations
- Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) calculations
- Usage forecasting
- Stock analytics

Key methods:
- `calculateStockStatus(part: Part): PartStatus`
- `generateStockAlerts(part: Part): StockAlert[]`
- `generateReorderRecommendations(parts: Part[]): ReorderRecommendation[]`
- `calculateEOQ(part: Part): number`

### React Hooks

#### useInventory()
Main hook for inventory management:
```typescript
const {
  parts,
  alerts,
  recommendations,
  dashboardData,
  isLoading,
  acknowledgeAlert,
  updateStock,
  createPurchaseOrder,
  criticalAlertsCount,
  refreshData
} = useInventory();
```

#### useRealTimeAlerts()
Hook for real-time alert notifications:
```typescript
const {
  alerts,
  isConnected
} = useRealTimeAlerts();
```

## üé® UI Components

### StockAlerts Component
- Displays alerts with filtering and sorting
- Severity-based color coding
- Bulk acknowledgment functionality
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### InventoryDashboard Component
- Key metrics and KPIs
- Inventory health visualization
- Critical alerts summary
- Top used parts analysis
- Quick action shortcuts

### NotificationSystem Component
- Real-time toast notifications
- Notification bell with badge counter
- Popover with recent alerts
- Dismissible notifications
- Quiet hours support

## üì± Mobile Optimization

The system is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices:
- Touch-friendly interface
- Swipe gestures for actions
- Optimized layouts for small screens
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support

## üîî Alert System

### Alert Severity Levels
- **CRITICAL** - Immediate attention required (out of stock, critical parts)
- **HIGH** - Urgent action needed (low stock on important parts)
- **MEDIUM** - Should be addressed soon (reorder points reached)
- **LOW** - Informational (overstock, minor issues)
- **INFO** - General information

### Alert Processing
1. **Generation** - Alerts are generated based on current stock levels
2. **Filtering** - Alerts are filtered by severity and type
3. **Notification** - Critical alerts trigger immediate notifications
4. **Acknowledgment** - Users can acknowledge alerts to mark as seen
5. **Escalation** - Unacknowledged critical alerts can escalate

## üìà Analytics and Forecasting

### Stock Analytics
- Average usage calculations
- Usage variance analysis
- Stock turnover rates
- Days of stock remaining
- Cost analysis (holding, ordering, stockout costs)

### Forecasting
- Simple moving average with trend analysis
- Seasonal factor adjustments
- Lead time considerations
- Safety stock calculations

### Economic Order Quantity (EOQ)
Automatic calculation of optimal order quantities based on:
- Annual demand
- Ordering costs
- Holding costs
- Lead times

- Total inventory value
- Low stock count
- Out of stock count
- Active alerts count
- Pending orders count

## üîí Security Considerations

- Input validation for all stock adjustments
- Audit trail for all inventory transactions
- Role-based access control (planned)
- Data encryption for sensitive information

## üìù Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```typescript
// Get inventory data
const { parts, alerts, recommendations } = useInventory();

// Acknowledge an alert
await acknowledgeAlert(alertId);

// Update stock quantity
await updateStock(partId, quantity, reason);

// Create purchase order
await createPurchaseOrder(partId, quantity);
```

### Advanced Usage
```typescript
// Generate custom alerts
const customAlerts = parts.flatMap(part => 
  inventoryService.generateStockAlerts(part)
);

// Calculate reorder recommendations
const recommendations = inventoryService.generateReorderRecommendations(parts);

// Get stock analytics
const analytics = inventoryService.calculateStockAnalytics(part, movements);
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Alerts not showing** - Check if alerts are enabled for the part
2. **Incorrect stock levels** - Verify stock movements and adjustments
3. **Performance issues** - Consider pagination for large inventories
4. **Notification not working** - Check browser permissions and settings

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting:
```javascript
localStorage.setItem('inventory-debug', 'true');
```
